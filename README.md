**Hello there!** 👋

**My name is Chuck, I'm a developer with a diverse skill set in programming, web design, mobile app development, and OS management. I’m adept at software installation and configuration.
A self-taught learner and tech enthusiast, I love deconstructing things to see how they work—always for the sake of learning and innovation! 😂**

🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Enhancing my skills in CMS development with Drupal and Wordpress, while also refining my HTML/CSS and PHP coding chops.

🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Advanced frameworks in PHP like Laravel and CodeIgniter, which have been both challenging and rewarding. I’m enjoying every step of this journey!

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Projects that push my boundaries and help me grow. I’m all about learning through doing, and what better way to do that than collaborating with fellow tech enthusiasts?

🤔 **I’m looking for help with:** Navigating the intricacies of PHP frameworks and understanding the best practices in web development. If you’ve got tips, tricks, or advice, I’m all ears!

⚡ **Fun fact:** I believe that the best way to learn is by breaking things apart, and yes, I’ve broken quite a few things in my tech journey so far. But hey, it’s all part of the learning process, right?

**Let’s keep breaking things and learning together!** 🛠️💻
